# Random Password Generator
A small application I made during learning Java basics. I'm sure that it could've been made in a more simple and elegant way, but this is a sort of learn by doing thing.

By default, the generator will create a random, 20 characters long password with the following character set:

> ```aAbBcCdDeEfFgGhHiIjJkKlLmMnNoOpPqQrRsStTuUvVwWxXyYzZ0123456789&@()^$-_+!%=#:?;\/.{}[]```

**Features:**
* specify length
* exclude/include special characters
* exclude/include ambiguous characters
* copies password directly to clipboard (no luck for Peeping Toms)
* save password as text file
